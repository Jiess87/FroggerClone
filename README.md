Intro
===============================

This game was made using https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game as a basis for
Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree program. Big thanks for the art assets and JavaScript game engine provided!

Installation and requirements
===============================

Simply put the containing folder anywhere on your computer and run the index.html file within it.

You will need a modern browser that supports HTLM5 and ES6 (Chrome, Firefox... Internet Explorer doesn't want you to have fun yet).

Rules and Gameplay
===============================

Use your keyboard's arrow keys to navigate the player character toward the water tiles at the top of the screen.

Once you do, the challenge starts again but with an extra enemy to avoid!

If you manage to a barrage of 5 enemies, you get to the next level!

...but the enemies will get progressively faster!

If by any chance you run out of the 5 beautiful lives (represented by hearts in the lower right of your game) given to you
at the beginning of the game, your game will end and you will have the option of starting over by pressign SPACEBAR on your keyboard.
